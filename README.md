# comp16_software
Software, including OS files, for [comp16](https://github.com/darksteelcode/comp16). Currently, software is very much in development, and may not work, be stable, have documentation, or be complete.

Requires an installation of [the comp16 assembler and build tools](https://github.com/darksteelcode/comp16_compilers) to build programs, and the [comp16_emulator](https://github.com/darksteelcode/comp16_emulator) is recommeneded to emulate programs. 

Should you want to use comp16, the fpga [source](https://github.com/darksteelcode/comp16) is required to use the microprossessor on an fpga - this is not easy to use at the moment.

To build these programs, type `make` in the home directory.
